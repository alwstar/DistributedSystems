**Getting started**

1. Run `start_server.py` file to start a server. If there is no existing Server in the DS the server will declare himsel as new `MAIN` server.
2. Run `start_server.py` a second time to add a new server to the DS. The `MAIN` server will answer the new server and assign him a group.
3. Run `client_register.py` to start a client and register him to a group.
